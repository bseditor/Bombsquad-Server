<h4 align="center">The Modded Server for The Game Called BOMBSQUAD with some Really Awesome UnderTheHood Features. I focused on speed and must have features rather than grafical mods (which you can easily get tons of mods on the internet). Mods are compiled against 'C-Extension' for having a speedy experience (My intension is not to hide the codes, i can even share it with anyone asked for) but their functions are easily callable to any python file (speed of C with the simplicity of Python)</h4>
